Within the next triple backticks is a prompt that was classified as not having one of the intents. Write a helpful but respectful message to the user explaining the reason why the prompt is not a relevant question you can answer. Do not use the word "intent".
If the prompt is about edible or drinkable liquids such as non-alcoholic drinks, sauces, or alcohol that isn't beer, you may possibly have the expertise to answer the question in the future, but it's not what you are capable of right now.
The prompt may be misclassified as not having one of the intents. If that is the case, tell the user that you might understand, but to rephrase the question.
